# Real World Kubernetes: Observe, Monitor, and Alert

This repo contains the resources for the Kubernetes class I teach that helps you understand what in the world is actually happening on your cluster. 

## Overview

ðŸ”­ This three hour action packed class is one giant demo of working code that you can use in your own environment.  We use a sample python application that is running on our kubernetes cluster and add monitoring, observabilty, and alerting so we can really understand the details of our cluster. 
In this class we cover: 

* Kubernetes GUI options including Lens and k9s. 
* Prometheus for gathering metrics
* Grafana Dashboards
* Alerting with Grafana metrics 
* Integration with Slack
* CloudWatch Alerts
* The FEK stack
* FluentD (td-agent) 
* LogServer (td-agent to files)
* Terraform ElasticSearch (OpenSearch)
* Session Logging 
* Searching Logs in Kibana
